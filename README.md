### 🔭 What I'm focused on
- Shipping a professional portfolio and three tight demo projects that show **UI quality, accessibility, and real-world workflows**.
- Consistent commits, clean READMEs, and small PRs that read like a real dev team.

### 🛠️ Tech I use
`HTML` • `CSS` • `JavaScript` • `React` • `Vite` • `Tailwind CSS` • `Git/GitHub`  
(also learning: `TypeScript`, `Node/Express` basics)

### 📌 Projects to check (once pinned)
- **dev-portfolio** — Responsive portfolio with dark/light themes and a11y score 100.
- **react-tasks-pro** — Task app with filters, localStorage sync, unit tests, and keyboard a11y.
- **api-dashboard** — Fetches public APIs (weather/news), loading/error states, and pagination.

> Each repo includes: a clear README, screenshots, a short Loom demo, and a “What I learned” section.

### 🧪 How I work
- Accessibility-first (semantic HTML, focus styles, ARIA only when necessary)
- Component-driven design (small, composable React components)
- Testing mindset for UI states (empty, loading, error, success)

### 🗺️ Roadmap (near-term)
- Add TypeScript to a project
- Build a small Node mock API for local dev
- Contribute to one open-source issue (docs or a small bug)
